### Software Installation
See the instructions for installation on the Wiki (link on the top of the repository) and watch the [installation video](https://youtu.be/8dL-y_1p3Kw).  You will also need to load the tidyverse packages from the consol in RStudio:  
> install.packages("tidyverse")  
> library(tidyverse)  

You only need to run the "install.packages" command once on your computer, but you will need to run the "library" command every time you open R/RStudio.
